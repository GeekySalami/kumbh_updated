      <strong>Who Are the People Who Visit Kumbh Mela?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Kumbh Mela</strong> is one of the largest and most significant
      spiritual gatherings in the world, held once every 12 years at four sacred
      locations in India: <strong>Prayag (Allahabad)</strong>,
      <strong>Haridwar</strong>, <strong>Ujjain</strong>, and
      <strong>Trimbakeshwar (Nashik)</strong>. It is a melting pot of people
      from all walks of life, united by their devotion, spirituality, and the
      quest for spiritual cleansing. The festival sees an extraordinary
      confluence of <strong>pilgrims</strong>, <strong>sadhus</strong>,
      <strong>ascetics</strong>, <strong>tourists</strong>,

      <strong>1. Pilgrims: The Heart of the Kumbh Mela</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The primary participants in the <strong>Kumbh Mela</strong> are the
      <strong>pilgrims</strong> who come from every corner of India, and
      increasingly, from across the globe. These devotees, often referred to as
      <strong>“kumbh yatris”</strong>, are primarily Hindu, seeking spiritual
      redemption through ritual bathing in the <strong>sacred rivers</strong> at
      the confluence (Sangam) of <strong>Ganga</strong>,
      <strong>Yamuna</strong>, and <strong>the mystical Saraswati</strong> at
      Prayag. This act of bathing is believed to wash away one's sins and grant
      liberation (moksha).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Kumbh Mela</strong> is also a destination for pilgrims
      practicing different forms of spirituality. Many participants come from
      diverse sects of Hinduism, including <strong>Shaivites</strong>,
      <strong>Vaishnavites</strong>, and <strong>Shaktas</strong>, each with
      their unique customs and rituals. People travel to witness the sacred
      event of <strong>Shahi Snan</strong> (royal bath), the grand bathing
      ceremony which is one of the major attractions of the event. For many,
      this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in the sacred rites.

      <strong>2. Sadhus and Ascetics: The Spiritual Custodians</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the most iconic features of the <strong>Kumbh Mela</strong> is the
      presence of <strong>sadhus</strong> and <strong>ascetics</strong>. These
      wandering monks have renounced worldly attachments in their pursuit of
      spiritual enlightenment. They come from various orders and sects, often
      belonging to the <strong>Akhadas</strong>, the spiritual organizations
      that have a long history and are central to the religious practices at the
      Kumbh. The <strong>Sadhus</strong> participate in the
      <strong>Shahi Snan</strong>, as well as perform various rituals and offer
      blessings to the pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ascetics, many of whom have lived a life of extreme austerity, are
      considered spiritual leaders and are revered by the devotees. Their
      presence is seen as a direct connection to the divine and serves as an
      embodiment of the <strong>sadhana</strong> (spiritual practice) that the
      festival represents.

      <strong>4. Vendors and Workers: The Temporary Town</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Kumbh Mela</strong> is not only a religious gathering but also
      a massive logistical event. The sheer number of people attending requires
      a huge infrastructure to support them, including
      <strong>accommodation</strong>, <strong>food</strong>,
      <strong>transport</strong>, and <strong>safety</strong> arrangements.
      Thousands of <strong>vendors</strong>, <strong>temporary workers</strong>,
      and <strong>service providers</strong> come to set up stalls and provide
      services such as food, clothing, and religious items. These workers are an
      essential part of the Mela, contributing to its smooth functioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, <strong>temporary accommodations</strong> are set up in the form
      of <strong>tents</strong>, which become a temporary town for the duration
      of the Mela. These areas, often referred to as
      <strong>“Kalpavasas”</strong>, host the pilgrims and workers. The
      temporary nature of this vast city adds to the unique character of the
      Mela.

      cleanliness and helping with the setup of the temporary city, volunteers
      play a pivotal role in maintaining order and supporting the needs of the
      pilgrims and visitors. These volunteers, often affiliated with different

      <strong>Shloka on the Importance of Pilgrimage</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The importance of pilgrimage and its spiritual significance can be found
      in various ancient texts, one of the most prominent being the
      <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >"सर्वे पुण्यात्मन: शान्ति: शान्ति: शान्ति: सन्ति तु"<br />
        “Sarve Punya Atmana: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Santi Tu.”</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Translation</em>: "The peace and tranquility found in the hearts of
      those who have undertaken pilgrimage and worship with devotion are
      unmatched and bring eternal serenity to the soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      This shloka speaks to the profound spiritual impact of pilgrimage, such as
      that experienced at the Kumbh Mela, where the physical journey becomes a
      means of attaining inner peace and spiritual growth.
