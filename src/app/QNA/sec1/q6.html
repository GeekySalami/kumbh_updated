  <strong>Planets Involved in Determining the Kumbh Mela</strong>
</h3>
<p>
  The Kumbh Mela is a magnificent confluence of spirituality, culture, and
  astronomy. The timing and location of this grand event are not arbitrary but
  are intricately determined by specific planetary alignments. Among the
  celestial bodies, Jupiter (<em>Brihaspati</em>), the Sun (<em>Surya</em>), and
  the Moon (<em>Chandra</em>) play the most significant roles in defining when
  and where the Kumbh Mela is held.

    <p><strong>Jupiter (Brihaspati)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Known as the <em>Dharma Guru</em> or the spiritual teacher of the
          gods, Jupiter is the primary determinant of the Kumbh Mela's location
          and timing.

        <p>
          The position of Jupiter in specific zodiac signs influences where the
          Kumbh is held:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Haridwar</strong>: Jupiter in Aquarius (<em
                >Kumbha Rashi</em
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Prayagraj</strong>: Jupiter in Taurus (<em
                >Vrishabha Rashi</em
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Nasik</strong>: Jupiter in Scorpio (<em
                >Vrishchika Rashi</em
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Ujjain</strong>: Jupiter in Leo (<em>Simha Rashi</em>).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Sun (Surya)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The Sun symbolizes vitality and divine light.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Its position in specific zodiac signs works in conjunction with
          Jupiter’s alignment to finalize the location. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <strong>Haridwar</strong>, the Sun is in Aries (<em
                >Mesha Rashi</em
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <strong>Prayagraj</strong>, the Sun is in Capricorn (<em
                >Makara Rashi</em
              >).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Sun's transit infuses the event with spiritual energy and
          signifies renewal and enlightenment.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Moon (Chandra)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Moon represents the mind and emotions, playing a complementary
          role to the Sun and Jupiter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Its alignment with the Sun and Jupiter further enhances the spiritual
          potency of the Kumbh. For instance, the Moon's position in Capricorn
          during Prayagraj Kumbh symbolizes balance and purification.

      are in Capricorn.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Nasik</strong>: When Jupiter is in Scorpio and the Sun is in Leo.

  <li>
    <p>
