  <p>
    The very essence of Kumbh Mela is the purification of the self. Pilgrims
    come to bathe in the sacred confluence of the rivers, but the physical
    purification goes hand in hand with the
    <strong>purification of thoughts</strong> and <strong>emotions</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Purity in Thoughts</strong>: The atmosphere at Kumbh is charged
        with spiritual energy, and to avail oneself of this energy, it is
        essential to have <strong>pure intentions</strong>. The experience of
        <strong>self-purification</strong> begins with clarity in thought, free
        from negative influences like anger, greed, and jealousy.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Purity in Actions</strong>: The act of
        <strong>selfless service</strong>, such as giving alms to the needy,
        helps cleanse the mind. Rituals like
        <strong>bathing in the sacred rivers</strong> are symbolic of the deeper
        <strong>inner cleansing</strong>.

  <p>
    A central principle of Kumbh Mela is <strong>humility</strong>—the ability
    to let go of ego and embrace the unity of all. Pilgrims and ascetics gather
    together, setting aside <strong>social status</strong> or
    <strong>worldly accomplishments</strong>. The
    <strong>spiritual equality</strong> at Kumbh Mela nurtures humility,
    reminding participants that <strong>material success</strong> does not
    define true spiritual wealth.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Selflessness in Service</strong>: Acts of charity, such as
        donating food, clothing, or money, are essential to the spiritual
        journey at Kumbh. The primary lesson is that one should not seek
        personal gain but instead contribute to the welfare of others.
