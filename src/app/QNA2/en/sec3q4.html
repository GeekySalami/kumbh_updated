    One of the earliest recorded royal figures to attend the Kumbh Mela was
    <strong>King Harshavardhan</strong>, who ruled northern India in the
    <strong>7th century</strong>. <strong>Xuanzang</strong>, the famous Chinese
    traveler, documented his visit to India during the time of Harshavardhan and
    mentioned the large congregation of people at <strong>Prayag</strong> (now
    <strong>Prayagraj</strong>) during the Kumbh. The king himself is said to
    have participated in the festival, making large charitable donations and
    even returning home wearing only the clothes he had on, having given away
    all his wealth to the poor. This noble act is a testament to the
    significance of the Kumbh Mela, which has always been a time for rulers to
    display their generosity and devotion to both spiritual and social welfare.

    As the Kumbh Mela continued through the centuries, it became a major event
    that attracted the attention of Indian <strong>Maharajas</strong> and
    <strong>Rajas</strong>. The grand spectacle of millions of devotees
    gathering at the banks of the sacred rivers, particularly the
    <strong>Ganges</strong>, was not only an occasion for spiritual reflection
    but also a chance for rulers to enhance their prestige. The
    <strong>Maharajas of Jaipur</strong>, the
    <strong>Maharajas of Baroda</strong>, and the
    <strong>Maharajas of Udaipur</strong> were some of the prominent royals who
    made their way to the Kumbh Mela over the years. Their participation in the
    festival was a display of their deep devotion to Hindu traditions and an
    opportunity for them to receive blessings from the holy waters of the
    <strong>Ganga</strong>.

  <p>
    The <strong>Ramcharitha Manasa</strong> (1574-1576) by
    <strong>Tulsidas</strong> also mentions royal patronage of the Kumbh Mela,
    showing that the kings of that time actively engaged in the Mela's rituals.
    The text references the contributions made by royal families, not only in
    terms of monetary donations but also through the building of temples, ghats,
    and other infrastructure that supported the pilgrims who came to the Mela.

    In more recent times, the Kumbh Mela continues to attract high-profile
    dignitaries and royals. The <strong>Maharaja of Varanasi</strong>,
    <strong>Maharaja of Udaipur</strong>, and even members of the
    <strong>Maharaja families of Rajasthan</strong> have participated in the
    Kumbh festivities. Their presence adds to the grandeur and reverence of the
    event. In addition to the royal visits, the Kumbh Mela in 2019 was also
    attended by <strong>envoys from 72 nations</strong>, signifying its
    increasing international recognition and appeal.

    The <strong>2013 Kumbh Mela</strong> was recognized by
    <strong>UNESCO</strong> as a
    <strong>“Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”</strong>, a monumental
    achievement that acknowledged the event's cultural and spiritual
    significance not just for India, but for the world. During the 2013 Kumbh,
    over <strong>120 million pilgrims and saints</strong> attended, making it
    the largest peaceful human gathering on Earth. This influx of visitors from
    around the world, including dignitaries, diplomats, and
    <strong>transnational media outlets</strong>, further cemented the global
    appeal of the Kumbh Mela.

  <p>
    The <strong>2013 Kumbh</strong> also marked the first time that the
    <strong>Ardh Kumbh</strong> (held every six years) was elevated to the level
    of the <strong>Kumbh</strong>, while the larger, more significant Kumbh held
    every twelve years was referred to as the <strong>Maha Kumbh</strong>. This
    reclassification recognized the evolving scale of the event and its
    increasing importance to both the local population and the international
    community.

    <strong>Rituals and Spiritual Significance at the Kumbh Mela</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The presence of royals at the Kumbh Mela has not only been a demonstration
    of political and social status but also a reflection of the spiritual power
    of the event. The central ritual of the <strong>Kumbh</strong> is the sacred
    dip in the holy <strong>Ganga</strong> (or other designated rivers), which
    is believed to wash away sins and lead to
    <strong>moksha</strong> (liberation). This belief is rooted in the ancient
    Hindu scriptures, and even the royals, despite their wealth and power,
    participated in the same rituals as common devotees, highlighting the
    equality and spiritual unity of all participants at the Mela.
  </p>
  <p>
    The act of bathing in the holy river is often preceded by
    <strong>pujas</strong> (rituals) and prayers, and the royal families would
    often sponsor or contribute to the organization of these religious
    activities. Their donations helped build infrastructure, including
    <strong>roads</strong>, <strong>pontoon bridges</strong>, and
    <strong>temples</strong>, which enhanced the experience for both the
    pilgrims and the saints who attended.
