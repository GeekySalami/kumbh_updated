  What is the astronomical significance of Kumbh mela held in Ujjain?
</question>

<answer>
  
  
  <p>
    The Kumbh Mela at Ujjain, also known as <em>Simhastha Kumbh Mela</em>, is
    deeply rooted in celestial alignments and astrological traditions. Among the
    four sites where the Kumbh Mela is held, Ujjain stands out for its
    association with the <em>Simhastha Yoga</em> and the sacred river Shipra.
    This event occurs when the <strong>Sun is in Aries</strong> (<em
      >Mesha Rashi</em
    >) and <strong>Jupiter is in Leo</strong> (<em>Simha Rashi</em>), a
    configuration that takes place during the Hindu month of Vaishakha
    (April-May). This unique alignment reflects the deep interplay of astronomy,
    mythology, and spirituality that defines the cultural and religious
    significance of the Kumbh Mela in Ujjain.

  <p>
    The timing of the Kumbh Mela in Ujjain is determined by a specific planetary
    alignment:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Jupiter in Leo</strong> (<em>Simha Rashi</em>): Symbolizing
        strength, wisdom, and cosmic order.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Sun in Aries</strong> (<em>Mesha Rashi</em>): Representing
        vitality, leadership, and new beginnings.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This configuration, known as <em>Simhastha Yoga</em>, sanctifies the period
    and elevates it to a time of heightened spiritual energy. Bathing in the
    Shipra River during this alignment is believed to wash away sins and bestow
    blessings, aligning individual energies with cosmic rhythms.

  <h3 id="mythological-significance">
    <strong>Mythological Significance</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Kumbh Mela is deeply intertwined with the legend of the
    <em>Samudra Manthan</em> (churning of the ocean of milk). During this cosmic
    event, nectar of immortality (<em>amrita</em>) was retrieved, and drops of
    it are believed to have fallen at four sacred locations, including Ujjain.
    This mythological connection elevates the Kumbh Mela at Ujjain as a
    celestial event that bridges the earthly and divine realms.
  </p>
  <p>
    The prominence of <em>Simha</em> (Leo) in Ujjain’s festival name reflects
    the mythological association with strength and divinity. According to
    tradition, bathing in the Shipra during this period grants spiritual
    liberation (<em>moksha</em>), aligning with the cosmic energies of the
    <em>Simhastha Yoga</em>.
  </p>
  <h3 id="historical-context"><strong>Historical Context</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Ujjain has been a renowned pilgrimage site since ancient times. While
    nineteenth-century literature (e.g., Hamilton, 1828) notes Ujjain’s
    spiritual prominence, the melas at Ujjain and Nasik were locally referred to
    as <em>Singhastha Melas</em>, emphasizing their connection to the Leo
    constellation. Unlike Allahabad and Haridwar, these events were not
    initially designated as Kumbh Melas, but over time, local priests adapted
    the Kumbh legends to highlight the spiritual significance of Ujjain.
