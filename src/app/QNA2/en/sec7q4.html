      settlement, albeit for a limited time. Its organization is intricate,
      involving multiple <strong>governmental departments</strong>,
      <strong>religious institutions</strong>, and
      <strong>local stakeholders</strong>. This unique structure is key to
      ensuring that the event runs smoothly and that all aspects—religious,
      social, and logistical—are harmonized.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Coordination of Pilgrims</strong>: These religious groups are
          also responsible for the <strong>accommodation</strong> and
          <strong>welfare</strong> of their followers during the Mela. They set

          facilitate the <strong>sacred baths</strong>.

      <strong>Shloka for Unity and Harmony at Kumbh Mela</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the spirit of the Kumbh Mela, where
      <strong>different religious, social, and cultural groups</strong> come
      together to celebrate the sacred, a shloka from the
      <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong> can be invoked to reflect the unity and
      harmony of the gathering:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्"<br /> </strong> (<em>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</em
      >)<br />
      <strong>Translation</strong>: <em>"The world is one family."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This shloka reminds us of the underlying essence of the Kumbh Mela, where
      individuals from diverse backgrounds unite under the banner of faith and
      spirituality. It emphasizes the collective nature of the event,
      highlighting the importance of cooperation between various institutions,
      communities, and individuals.
