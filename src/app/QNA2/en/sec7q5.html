    </h3>
    <p>
      To address safety concerns, authorities conduct a comprehensive
      <strong>Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk (HVR) analysis</strong>. This involves
      assessing the <strong>probability of incidents</strong> based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Historical data</strong>: Past events provide valuable
          insights into potential hazards.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Current vulnerabilities</strong>: Analysis of infrastructure,
          crowd density, and health risks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Risk probability</strong>: The likelihood of various
          incidents, such as stampedes, fires, or disease outbreaks, occurring.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The HVR analysis is a systematic method used to identify and evaluate the
      risks associated with the event. By understanding these risks, planners
      can design appropriate mitigation strategies to minimize incidents and
      ensure the safety of attendees.

      <strong>protection and divine care</strong> is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >"सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः।<br />
        सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चिद्दुःखभाग्भवेत्॥"</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Translation</strong>:
      <em
        >"May all beings be happy; may all beings be free from illness.<br />
        May all beings see what is auspicious, and may no one suffer."</em
      >
      (Bhagavad Gita 16.24)
