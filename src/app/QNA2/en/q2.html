    holds a unique position as it is closely associated with the mythological

    <strong>Astronomical Basis of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The timing of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar is determined by the following
    celestial configuration:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Jupiter enters Aquarius</strong> (<em>Kumbha Rashi</em>),</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <strong>Sun transitions into Aries</strong> (<em>Mesha Rashi</em>).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This alignment occurs approximately every 12 years, making it a recurring
    and highly anticipated event. According to Prof. D.P. Dubey, the term
    <em>Kumbh Parva</em> derives its name from this auspicious occasion of
    ritual bathing in Haridwar. The alignment symbolizes the cosmic connection
    between celestial bodies and human spirituality, emphasizing the purifying
    and transformative energies associated with these astrological positions.

    <strong>Mythological Connections</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The mythological roots of the Kumbh Mela are tied to the
    <em>Samudra Manthan</em> (the churning of the ocean of milk) described in
    Hindu scriptures. During the churning, the nectar of immortality
    (<em>amrita</em>) emerged, and drops of it were said to have spilled at four
    locations, including Haridwar. This sanctified the city, and the Ganga River
    flowing through it became a medium for spiritual purification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Skanda Purana specifically mentions the astrological conjunctions
    associated with the Kumbh Mela, linking them to these mythological events.
    Bathing in the Ganga at Haridwar during the Kumbh is believed to cleanse
    one's sins and bestow blessings for liberation (<em>moksha</em>).

  <p>
    As noted by scholars such as Bhattacharya (1977), there is no clear mention
    of <em>Kumbhayoga</em>—the specific astrological configuration defining the
    Kumbh Mela—in ancient astronomical texts. Instead, the association of
    celestial events with the mela seems to have evolved over time. Rathnasree
    (2001) highlights that there is considerable disagreement among Hindu
    astrologers regarding the precise constellations that determine the
    festival's timing. Despite these variations, Haridwar's Kumbh remains a
    major spiritual event, drawing millions of devotees.
