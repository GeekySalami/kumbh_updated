      gathering, is not just a spiritual event; it is a profound pilgrimage that
      draws millions of devotees from around the world to the confluence of

      As one of the most significant religious festivals in Hinduism, the Kumbh
      Mela's main focus is the <strong>confluence</strong> of the
      <strong>Ganga</strong>, <strong>Yamuna</strong>, and the mythic
      <strong>Saraswati</strong> rivers, but there are numerous other pilgrimage
      sites in and around the event that hold great importance. Let’s delve into
      some of the key places every pilgrim should visit during the Kumbh Mela.

      The central destination during the Kumbh Mela is

      <strong>Sangam</strong>, the confluence of the <strong>Ganga</strong>,
      <strong>Yamuna</strong>, and the <strong>Saraswati</strong> rivers, takes
      place. This location is considered one of the holiest places in Hinduism.
      Bathing at the Sangam during the Kumbh is believed to wash away all sins,
      purifying the soul and granting liberation. This is the
      <strong>sacred act</strong> most pilgrims come to perform during the Mela.
